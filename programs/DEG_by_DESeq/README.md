# An Rscript program to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using DESeq or DESeq2

The comparison can be made for samples both within and between
organisms. Please run the program
[exp_diff_by_DESeq.orth.R](exp_diff_by_DESeq.orth.R) without
any parameter for a brief usage introduction.

A more detailed will be here later.
